The file is generated in tabular-separated (TSV) format composed of 12 fields, a format corresponding to the format generated by BLAST using the option -outfmt 6. The 12 fields are:

Query accession: the accession of the sequence that was the search query against the database, as specified in the input FASTA file after the > character until the first blank.

Target accession: the accession of the target database sequence (also called subject) that the query was aligned against.

Sequence identity: The percentage of identical amino acid residues that were aligned against each other in the local alignment.

Length: The total length of the local alignment, which including matching and mismatching positions of query and subject, as well as gap positions in the query and subject.

Mismatches: The number of non-identical amino acid residues aligned against each other.

Gap openings: The number of gap openings.

Query start: The starting coordinate of the local alignment in the query (1-based).

Query end: The ending coordinate of the local alignment in the query (1-based).

Target start: The starting coordinate of the local alignment in the target (1-based).

Target end: The ending coordinate of the local alignment in the target (1-based).

E-value: The expected value of the hit quantifies the number of alignments of similar or better quality that you expect to find searching this query against a database of random sequences the same size as the actual target database. This number is most useful for measuring the significance of a hit. By default, DIAMOND will report all alignments with e-value < 0.001, meaning that a hit of this quality will be found by chance on average once per 1,000 queries.

Bit score: The bit score is a scoring matrix independent measure of the (local) similarity of the two aligned sequences, with higher numbers meaning more similar. It is always >= 0 for local Smith Waterman alignments.
